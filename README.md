# DOM Practice continued...

## Description

Here are a few practice exercises to interact with the DOM but this time in react! Try and complete as much as you can without using the solutions, as we are practicing all the skills involved in web development! I would suggest only looking at the solutions after you have your own working example, or you have exhausted your google searches. This time you can figure out the last two by yourself. If you get stuck then reach out for the solutions.

### Setup

1. Clone this repository

2. cd into the folder and run `npm install`

3. Implement solutions in `App.js` for each of the exercises

**HINT**: Hints are available in the `hints` directory and solutions in `solutions`

Try completing each exercise on your own, before checking the hints or solutions.

### What's next?

1. Try recreating each of the sections in a separate component.
2. Use your knowledge of testing to run some tests on the exercises
3. Refactor your code to use the best coding practices
